## Name: MIT xPRO Week 3 Extension of Ball Bonus Project

### Description:

Click the button titled "Click to create balls!" as many times as you'd like to generate balls with random colors and positions within a set area on the screen. Then click the button titled "Start simulation". This will launch each ball with a random initial vertical and horizontal velocity. The balls will move as projectiles once launched, and each time they bounce, they will lose energy and fade until they disappear. Click "Pause simulation" to pause the simulation at any time. The simulation button text toggles back and forth between "Start simulation" and "Pause simulation". 

#### Installation:

N/A

#### Usage: 

I created this in my third week of the programming course, so I have stopped using "var" as much to declare variables. 

#### Support:

N/A

#### Roadmap: 

I think a logical next extension is for me to add an event listener so that you can click on the screen to create each ball. I wanted to get buttons and arrays working first though.
