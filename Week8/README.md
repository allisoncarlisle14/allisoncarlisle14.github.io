## Name: MIT xPRO Week 8 Styling My Calculator Bonus Project

### Description:

This week, we focused on styling with CSS. I decided to add styling features to my calculator program, using the CSS grid layout to give the calculator a better overall appearance. I styled my buttons so that they change color when hovered over, move and eliminate shadows when clicked, and are opaque when not pressable. Making the buttons opaque at the right times required figuring out which buttons were not pressable after a certain button was pressed, whereas last week, I focused on figuring out if a given button could be pressed based on what had just been pressed. It also involved implementing a system to keep track of how many open and closed parentheses had been entered, given that the equal button should not be available if they are unbalanced. 

#### Installation:

N/A

#### Usage: 

I created this in my eighth week of the programming course primarily to practice CSS.

#### Support:

#### Roadmap: 

I don't have any plans to improve on this project, but I think I could add a button to switch between degree and radian mode now that I am tracking parentheses already.
