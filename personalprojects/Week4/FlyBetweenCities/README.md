## Name: MIT xPRO Week 4 Fly Between Cities Project #2

### Description:

First, click the dot next to any city's name on the map to spawn a plane there. (I included the five most populous cities in the US). Next, click a different city's dot to fly the plane to a new destination. Once the plane arrives, you can continue clicking on other city dots to move the plane around the map.
